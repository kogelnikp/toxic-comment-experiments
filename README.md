# Convolutional Neural Networks for Toxicity Detection in Online Comments

This repository contains experiments with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of toxic online comments.
The experiments are intended to help answering the following questions:

* How suitable are different CNN architectures for the toxic comment classification task?
* Which preprocessing steps are beneficial for this type of problem?
* Which patterns do CNNs learn and which features are important for the classification when being trained on this data?
* Do CNNs work equally well when being applied to data coming from different sources?
